Hi there, I'm Ryan <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>
------------------------------------------------
I am a full stack developer who is still trying to get his feet wet in the industry.
I went through a 28 week rigiorous online boot-camp and passed with flying colors.
I am looking for my first position as a software engineer.
I currently am doing tech support for an Oklahoma local company.
I am currently going through another course online learning everything I can about js and react.
